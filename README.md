A *production-ready* image for Praxis Time Odoo SAAS-6 
======================================================

This image weighs just over 1Gb. Keep in mind that Odoo is a very extensive suite of business applications written in Python. We designed this image with built-in external dependencies and almost nothing useless. It is used from development to production with various community addons. 

Odoo version
============

This docker builds with a tested version of Odoo (formerly OpenERP) AND related dependencies. We do not intend to follow the git. The packed versions of Odoo have always been tested against our CI chain and are considered as production grade. We update the revision pretty often, though :)

This is important to do in this way (as opposed to a latest nightly build) because we want to ensure reliability and keep control of external dependencies.

You may use your own sources simply by binding your local Odoo folder to /opt/odoo/sources/odoo/

Here are the current revisions from https://github.com/odoo/odoo/archive/saas-6.tar.gz for each docker tag
